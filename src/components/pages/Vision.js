                        At Phoenix Labs, we are curious, innovative, and bold. We are testing and exceeding the limitations of what technology can do. We are a
                        growing team of people with big ideas, who are both thinkers and doers. Our people move quickly and thrive on working towards solutions
                        to the problems that plague societies across the globe. <br /> <br />
                        We are committed to recruiting talented individuals, groups, and teams, and providing them with opportunities to influence the future of
                        marginalized groups for the better. It is here that we take risks, promote visionary expression, and focus on bridging the gap between
                        Lack and Abundance by seamlessly integrating diverse humans and technology.
